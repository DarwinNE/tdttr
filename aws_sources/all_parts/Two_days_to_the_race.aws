Your uncle doesn't live here; he's married and has two children and he owns a smaller villa, nearby. However, he still likes to work here, at the light coming from the large window on the south wall. He draws the bodies of cars as well as their accessories: his talent is one of the undoubted reasons of the success of ITA, along with your father's mechanical prowess. There's a desk close to the window.

It's a comfortable place, lit by a large gas chandelier carrying five lamps. There's a window on the north wall with your desk under it. You always loved reading and the east wall is completely covered by your library, full of books. Your bed is on the west side and seems to be very comfortable, close to a chest of drawers, a washbowl with a mirror and a closet. The decoration of the furniture is floral, very refined. You like this place.

You're in the vast barn hosting the garage of the villa. It's here your family keeps your two cars. Of course, they're two models by ITA. The model 101, a large luxury three cylinder car and the model 51, a two cylinder sports car. In the barn you've everything you need to keep the cars running: water to fill up the water reservoirs for the steam, a set of tools and plenty of coal.

Small bottles are empty, clean and ready to be filled, close to a steam centrifuge. A small wooden cabinet has a window and you can see hundreds of those little bottles, full of a clear liquid. Their tags and the small brown bricks don't leave any doubt: in this place, someone secretly produces morphine!

It's your father's desk. It's a large mahogany desk with decorated legs. Your father meets clients and other people at the factory, but here he can work much more quietly.
2
Your uncle's desk is simple and contains everything he needs for his work.
3
You see part of the garden, lit by a magnificent sunset.
4
You have a look of the backyard, where the barn opens.
5
These are portraits of your grandfather and your grandmother, from your mother's side.
6
It's a wall, lit by a wonderful sunset.
7
Be more specific!
8
It's an envelope with the name of your father on it.
9
Your father deals with personal matters on this desk.
10
From your window, you can see the street that passes alongside the back of the villa. The horizon is an urban landscape at the sunset. Far on the left side, you can see the shape of the local gasometer.
11
It's your chest of drawers, full of your underwear.
12
You're already dressed, and with taste. You don't need that.
13
There's nothing special to see.
14
Your closet's already open.
15
In the closet, you find your clothes and a strange leather box.
16
It's your closet. You should know what there's inside, but in case you forgot, try to open it!
17
The portraits represent your grandfather and your grandmother, from your father side. You remember them well. Your grandparents used to play with you but they died when you were five and seven years old. Here, they seem young and happy.
18
You aren't tired.
19
It's not raining. There are no umbrellas there.
20
It's the town of Cherasco. Your grandfather came to Turin sixty years ago and met your grandmother there.
21
There's nothing special about the frame.
22
Your father uses to deal with personal matters on this desk. While you're looking in the drawers, the cat begins to play with something under your father's bed.
23
Your father uses to deal with personal matters on this desk. There's an open envelope on it but nothing else. I wonder where the letter is.
24
You look under your father's bed and you find Democrito playing with a letter, crumpled up.
25
There are two bowls: one is filled with water and one is empty.
26
You put the anchovy in the empty bowl. Democrito pounces and eats it quickly and happily. Lucky cat! When he finishes, he purrs and gently rubs himself against your legs.
27
The pantry is full of jars and cans. In a corner, on a little plate, you notice a small anchovy, already desalted.
28
The pictures on the wall represent moments of the history of ITA. One picture in particular was taken as the Prime Minister was shaking hands with your father and your uncle. Founded in 1894, thanks to several very successful models, in just a few years the factory went from a small family business to the biggest car company in Italy. ITA gained a reputation for technologically advanced and reliable steam cars.
29
There are many blueprints here. The most recent ones are those for the Autosigma, a steam prototype that ITA prepared for the race in two days. Your father and your uncle clearly spent a lot of time and money on this. You are aware of their work and you know it contains many improvements. Stealing the prototype would be very appealing for industrial espionage, but here the blueprints are well protected.
30
You see the sky, lit by a beautiful sunset. Your villa is in the Crocetta, an elegant residential neighbourhood. You see the avenue passing in front of your house and the trees, coloured with shades turning from orange to pink.
31
The pantry is full of jars and cans. There's nothing very interesting.
32
The cabinet is where the various keys of the villa are kept. Obviously enough, the key of the ITA 51's there.
33
There are plenty of interesting objects on the shelves: if you're an Egyptologist, this place's heaven.
51
It's a relatively small car, beautifully crafted and very light. It's a steam car, of course, with a steam generator and a two cylinder engine driving the back wheels. It's a recent model and can be turned on in less than one minute. It can reach 120 km/h in the hands of a good pilot. By the way, as a daughter worthy of your father's name, you're a good pilot and, of course, you know how to drive it. Naturally, it's red and has a rose painted on it.
52
You need the key to drive the car.
53
You need to wear your goggles to drive the car.
54
You put some water in the reservoir and ignite the coal burner. Democrito's scared by the noise of the burner and runs away. After less than a minute, you hear a soft thump and the needle of the steam manometer enters a green sector. You adjust the steam generator and press the throttle pedal. The car begins to move, gently at first and then faster. Egyptian Museum, here you come!
55
You're no tourist. There's no reason to go there.
56
The museum keeper appears, barking "The museum's closed, closed! What are you doing here?! Go away!" and pushes you outside.
57
The museum keeper says: "The museum's closed now," in a very bored tone. He would clearly like to be elsewhere...
58
You take one copy of "La Stampa", the local newspaper and you give 5 cents to the newspaper boy inside the kiosk.
59
You're not here to read newspapers. However, on the first page there's a column about the government's plan to combat unemployment, some lines about the retirement of General Luigi Pelloux, gossips about the Duchess of Orléans in Paris and, more enthralling, a column about Madame Butterfly, a new opera from Puccini.
60
The museum keeper takes the newspaper with a light in his eyes: he seems to be very intrigued about Puccini's new opera. He barely thanks you and enters his cabinet behind the ticket office. That will keep him occupied for a while.
61
The panel contains a list of all the directors of the museum. Schiaparelli is the last one, still in charge. He's a friend of your father and knows something about the stolen car. You're here to meet him!
62
You know well the legend of Iunnuh. Schiaparelli himself liked to tell it to you when you were a child. Iunnuh was the greatest pharaoh and his deeds were both wonderful and terrible. Many think that he's just a legend, Iunnuh's pyramid will never be found and the treasures it contains will never see the light again. Others (such as Schiaparelli) think Iunnuh's secrets will be revealed one day.
63
The door's locked. You should examine the strange mechanism and find a way to operate it to open the door.
64
The mechanism locking the door is one of your father's inventions. You recognise the style and there are his initials A.V. It's a combination lock he built for Schiaparelli. There are seven disks that must be aligned in the right way. Of course, the symbols on them are hieroglyphs! You will not activate the mechanism without the right combination. By the way, the room is full of papyri: you hope the combination is not to be found here, as you would need a week to try out everything.
65
The room is full of papyri. You notice the fragments of the King List describing pharaohs before Ramses II. You see also the Judicial Papyrus. There's the Strike Papyrus on the north side and you also notice, hidden in a corner, the Erotic Papyrus, with grotesque couples copulating in a variety of manners.
66
You've a variety of skills, but you can not decipher hieroglyphs. You may ask to Schiaparelli if you can meet him!
67
The famous Erotic Papyrus is grotesque and quite funny, even if only some fragments are conserved. It's also funny how they've put it in a corner, almost hidden.
68
It's the King List of Turin, composed of many fragments. It's an important source for the chronology of ancient pharaohs.
69
It' a lock built by your father. You know it's well made: you'll need too much time and appropriate tools to pick it. What's more, Schiaparelli would not be happy at all about it!
70
You examine the exposed objects in the shrines. You notice a small piece of limestone (an ostrakon), where a female dancer is beautifully drawn, the pale colour of her skin gently touched by the light of the sunset. She is almost naked, arcing her back acrobatically and her thin silhouette is drawn with grace and elegance. Her curly hair is long and flowing and touches the ground. She wears golden earrings. You stand stunned for a few seconds, absorbed in admiration, almost as if you'd expect the little figure to become once again alive now, more than 3000 years after the death of the woman who inspired the artist, to complete her acrobatic jump in front of your eyes: it's a small portrait, but it's a mind-blowing masterpiece.
71
You read that those are reproductions of engravings from the book "Description de l'Egypte, ou recueil des observations et des recherches qui ont été faites en Egypte pendant l'expédition de l'armée française, publié par les ordres de Sa Majesté l'Empereur Napoléon le Grand". They are beautifully framed and depict, among other things, scenes of everyday life during the era of pharaohs.
72
It's the description of the first known strike, done by workers in Deir el-Medina. They wanted to improve their conditions while working to the fabrication and the decoration of tombs in the Valley of the Kings.
73
The room contains several magnificent and colossal statues. You stand in front of a large statue of Tuthmosis III. You also notice the impressive statue of Amenhotep II and a ram, on the other side of the room.
74
It's a statue of the pharaoh Amenhotep II, kneeling, holding two globular vases in his hands. He was hailed as a great warrior and a great athlete and the muscles in the arms of the statue are vibrant and seem ready for battle.
75
It's a representation of a ram, of a considerable size, protecting a figure of pharaoh Amenhotep III.
76
It's a colossal statue representing pharaoh Tuthmosis III.
77
You see a panel with a sign "Welcome" and then some hieroglyphs. It's elegant!
78
Wait a second... if you had to choose, you'd probably use something like that as a combination for the door lock!
79
Well... let's see: the panel sign contained a flowering reed with legs, then walking legs... no, wait, it was the reed that was walking... no, it does not work! The second symbol was a head, maybe? Uh, you can't remember the combination! You should copy it down somewhere...
80
You copy with care the message on the panel: a flowering reed with legs, a reed, walking legs, the owl, an offering tablet, a half circle and a small square. It must be a welcome message written with hieroglyphs. Quite plausible as a door combination! Definitely worth a try.
81
To copy the panel, I need something to write and a piece of paper...
82
The desk is quite messy. You notice many books, a pack of photographs representing the displayed objects and a blank sheet of paper.
83
You rotate the wheels until the combination matches the greeting written on the panel: the hieroglyphs that you copied on the sheet of paper. It works! The lock emits a sharp note and the door is now open, with a small puff of steam escaping from the lock.
84
You already have the message copied on paper!
85
^MWhen you knock and open the door, you see Schiaparelli at his desk. He looks perplexed, but then happy to see you: "Emilia? How did you convince Temistocle to let you in? ... You're like your father! I know that nothing can stop either of you when you have something in mind... I tried to contact him: my friend Giacomo Antonio Luzzi, the chemistry professor, saw a former employee of ITA, Attilio Belisario at the university, speaking with one of his assistants, Riccobene. He overheard him saying '... that prototype is valuable and interests someone I know...' He knew that Belisario was fired four months ago for stealing at the factory. Luzzi also suspects Riccobene's doing something strange at the chemistry department, but he doesn't know what. This is all I know."^MYou thank hip politely. You like this man: he is like your uncle, a very refined man with great culture. You decide to go immediately to the Chemistry Department of the university, hoping to find something about the car.^MAs you are leaving the office, Schiaparelli says "Emilia... I'm going to Egypt next year: I suspect some sites hide true archaeological treasures. We need people like you: why don't you join my expedition?" You thank him again saying you'll think about it.
86
There are some chairs for people to wait to meet the director. You're in a hurry and nobody is here. You're not going to sit down and wait right now...
87
You like that theatre: you have watched some memorable plays there. People are going inside, as it's open tonight. What a pity that you can't go there now!
88
That palace has a nice brick facade.
89
It's a newspaper kiosk selling La Stampa, the local daily newspaper. It's still open.
90
It's an impressive entrance. Quite appropriate for a museum.
91
It would not be very interesting.
92
He's a middle-aged man with bloodshot eyes and yellow teeth. He does not seem to have a very friendly attitude, but at least he's whistling some operatic aria.
93
It describes the trial against conspirators who killed Ramesse III in the so called Harem conspiracy.
94
The four mummies are well conserved and on one of them the bandages have been partially removed. You can see the expression of the dry face of the corpse, somewhat peaceful after a sleep of more than three thousand years. It must be very impressive for the small kids that visit the museum!
95
An Egyptian sphinx is a lion with a male human head. Thought to possess legendary strength, it was placed to guard the entrance to temples and tombs.
96
I know that on other interactive fiction games it's common to break shrines, but trust me: you will not need a mummy to keep you company while you're trying to understand what happened to a car prototype.
97
I open the small valve that allows the water to drip on the small block of carbide. The acetylene generated exits the burner with an acrid smell. You light it with a match and a bright white flame is produced by the lamp.
98
You close the small valve and the water stops dripping. After a few seconds, the acetylene stops flowing and burning. The lamp is now off.
99
It's a nice acetylene lamp. Water on a small block of carbide generates acetylene. It's burning with a nice white flame.
100
You can not turn on the lamp without something to ignite the flame.
101
The model 101 is a large car: a black torpedo with the driver's seat separated from the passengers' compartment, very comfortable and lined with red velvet. Your family does not have a chauffeur, though, as you, your father and your uncle like to drive personally. The steam generator feeds a three cylinder engine that develops more than 60 HP, almost in complete silence and with a generous torque and adequate accelerations.
102
No, the 101 is not the right car for small trips.
105
"Hello sweet little kitty!" Democrito seems happy when he hears your voice and begins to purr.
106
It's a classic laboratory bench that you find in chemistry laboratories. On top of it, you see a Soxhlet extractor on a Bunsen gas burner, off. It's probably used for a demonstration for students. There are some matches, to light the Bunsen burner.
107
It's a Soxhlet extractor. There's a glass pot full with ether, used as a solvent for the extraction. On the top of the extractor two rubber pipes bring the cold water during the extraction. The extractor is not working, now.
108
It's a Bunsen burner, placed under the extractor. It's off.
109
You're not here to play with chemistry! Leave that off.
110
They contain reagents. I wonder what I could do with them.
111
They're ordinary matches. They start fire if you strike them...
112
There's a certain amount of coal, close to the boiler. That's normal. It seems to be stored on a metallic manhole cover. That's less normal.
113
You'd need something to move all the coal.
114
You quickly remove all the coal from the manhole cover with the shovel. There's a hole that allows to remove the cover with the handle. You leave the shovel on the floor: it's not practical to carry it around. You look inside the manhole. You see a ladder, but it's dark there.
115
On the south wall, there's a door, shut.
116
You put the key in the lock: it's old and it does not open immediately. After a while, you succeed and you open the door.
117
There's an old yet robust lock. You can not open it without the right key.
118
It's a laboratory coat, used by the professor who last lectured here to avoid having chalk everywhere on the clothes. There's a tag with a name: "L. Riccobene" and there's a pocket that contains a key.
119
It's a laboratory coat, used by the professor who last lectured here to avoid having chalk everywhere on the clothes. There's a tag with a name: "L. Riccobene".
138
I can't move in the dark!
139
While you're walking, you feel someone grabbing you from your back. A rag covers your mouth and nose: you try to scream but you can't and you feel the characteristic smell of ether. After a few instants your vision becomes dazzled and you feel as you were falling into darkness. You lose conscience.
140
You wake up in a tiny room, with wooden floor and metallic walls, it's the inside of a freight wagon. You have a feeling of nausea, but you are not harmed.^M
141
It's very similar to the equipment you saw in the lab upstairs. The difference is that here it's extracting morphine and it's working right now!
142
Some of the bottles are empty and some are full of a clear, viscous liquid. Tag says it's morphine.
143
It's a Bunsen burner, placed under the extractor. It's on.
144
There's a set of test bottles, a pair of condensers, rubber pipes and clay, useful to assemble and seal glass equipments.
145
You knew once someone that developed a dependance from drugs. It's not a nice story. Don't touch that and leave morphine to physicians.
146
It's an old distillation column, a piece of glass of an impressive size. Probably it wasn't very efficient and they put it here, to impress students.
147
You're too far, but you know they have a wonderful smell.
148
It's a wonderful smell. It reminds you your mother: many years ago you used to play together in this garden in this season.
149
You are not here as a tourist, to visit the Egyptian Museum and to eat in a nice Italian restaurant. Your fritto misto alla piemontese has to wait for a while.
150
This building hosts the chemistry department of the University of Turin. It has been in use for two years, right now.
151
There are chemical formulas written on it. Apparently, they are reactions of ferric chloride etching copper and other metals.
152
There's a large object under the tarpaulin: it's a car. You have a look at it and your heart jumps: you've found the Autosigma prototype! You don't have much time and you hardly lose any: you run through the courtyard and get outside through a large gap in the gate. You recognise the stadium in front of you. It's not very far from the Crocetta, where you live. You run to your family's villa, where you find your uncle Tullio, in the middle of the night, much preoccupied about your absence.^MYou call the police and Riccobene and  Belisario are arrested while they are still trying to master the fire. The prototype is returned at the ITA factory and it's kept under guard.^M^MNow, you can rest. But not too much. The day after tomorrow you're going to pilot the car in the race and you need a good night's sleep. This is your last thought as your head sinks into your pillow.^MFinal code word: COUNTACH!^M^MThank you to have played to this game.
153
As you approach you overhear a conversation between two people. They must be Riccobene, the assistant of professor Luzzi and Belisario, the former employee of ITA, fired for having stolen tools:^M^M"-You're crazy, crazy! I hope that we'll be well paid for the car. The girl discovered us and we need to leave Turin now!^M-Shut up! What would you do, kill her? That would just make things worse. I said that we're going to be well paid and in two days we'll be in Geneva sipping champagne. Your boss, Luzzi, was already suspicious of the lab and it's a good time to leave! The girl'll wake up with a headache and she'll be found tomorrow after we've left this place. I hate this city and I can't wait to leave."^MThey continue chatting about wines they'll buying in Geneva.
154
You can not get inside: Riccobene and Belisario are there, and you don't want to be discovered. You should lure them outside.
155
You explore carefully the wooden floor with your hands. One of the boards moves if you put your weight on it.
156
With a certain difficulty, you can lift the board. It's heavy, but you're very lucky! You can get outside of the wagon, now.
157
You look carefully at the walls, made by wooden boards bolted on a metallic frame. There's no way to get outside from it.
158
Those are pretty ordinary freight wagons. They're used to move goods on railways. They're here because they need some repairs and you just escaped from one of them.
159
They're the gas burners that light this place. They're a simple, practical and undecorated model, perfect for an industrial environment.
160
There's a lot of stuff on this bench. It's mostly welding equipment. You notice in particular a lighter.
161
It stinks!
162
There's a lot of stuff on this bench. It's mostly welding equipment.
163
You set fire to sawdust with the lighter found in the welding shop. Maybe this is not the best thing you could possibly do, but the place seems to be well protected against a sawdust fire and it should not damage too much. After a few minutes, the fire is large, noisy and rather scary-looking. You hide yourself in a corner. Belisario and Riccobene come in. Belisario screams: "-What the hell? I knew it was a bad idea to keep so much sawdust in a single place!" They both try to control the fire and will be busy with buckets and water for a while. While they're occupied, you sneak outside, unnoticed.
164
It's a freight wagon. It seems ready to leave and there's a large lock on the door.
165
You try to open the wagon door, but it's locked. There's no wooden board in the floor that can be moved in this case, unfortunately!
166
You try to open the lock with the key found in the office and, sure enough, it opens!
167
Riccobene and Belisario are still in the carpentry shop, trying to master the fire. Better avoid them!
168
There's a mess on the desk. Among other things, there are tiny bottles of morphine and two syringes. You won't touch that. You see a large key, though, almost hidden under a small notepad.
169
You take the notepad on the desk. It's full of recipes, chemistry formulae and the description of the effects of the morphine. Probably Riccobene tested different recipes, observing the results on himself. Better leave that here!
170
Usually a tarpaulin's used to cover something. You may lift it to find what the object is...
210
You still don't know what happened exactly. Try to find your uncle and ask him.
220
It's your bed. It's comfortable.
221
It's your washbowl. You use it every day for your morning toilette.
222
It's a sheet of paper, from a notepad. You copied some hieroglyphs on it.
223
It's a sheet of paper, from a notepad. It's blank.
224
It's a grease pencil. It has been used a lot and it's short, but it's sharp.
225
It's a small key, but it seems rather old.
226
It's rather large and rusty. It probably opens an old lock.
227
You can not buy much with that.
228
It's a pretty ordinary key. The ITA symbol is composed of the three letters, with a rose and a laurel wreath on top. Your mother drew it.
229
You should take some change with you before leaving.
230
It's your desk. You like to write, but now it's tidy and clean.
231
It's not the best way to solve your problems.
232
You caress Democrito, your cat. He seems very happy to see you!
233
He's your pet, a Siamese tabby mix and is very gentle. He is a relatively small cat, but with soft long hair.
234
It's from Ernesto Schiaparelli, a longtime family friend: ^M^M"Dear Attilio,^M   your brother informed me about the race and the prototype you developed. I think it's a great opportunity for you and your factory. However, I know that you had troubles in the past and I think you should do whatever possible to put the prototype in a safe place until the race. My friend Luzzi, the chemistry professor that worked with you once, heard some strange things at the university and I would like very much to discuss that with you, urgently. For the moment, I only know it's better to keep the prototype secret and safe. Come to meet me in two or three days, if you can.^M^MYour friend Ernesto."^M^MThe date is July 23, 1902, two days ago. It looks like your father didn't pay a lot of attention to that letter, but now you must definitely go to see him!^MSchiaparelli's the director of the Egyptian Museum: you must go there.^M
235
It's a letter, handwritten on Egyptian Museum's letterhead.
236
Your uncle seems very excited: "I knew someone was trying to frame us! Emilia: the Autosigma prototype has been stolen. We will not be able to participate in the race in two days' time. It will be a catastrophe, as the company needs advertisement from the race. I'm going to the factory right now."^MThen, your uncle dashes out of the room.
237
Tullio is your uncle. He is about 40 years old and he is the younger brother of your father. He sports a brown beard and is always dressed in a very formal way, but without ostentation. He is a great artist in his field.
238
Tullio is not here.
239
You see your pilot goggles in the box.
251
You take Democrito in your arms and he begins to purr while you caress him. After a while, he clearly lets you understand he wants to be put down and you do that.
252
It's really not the right time to prepare a full-fledged bagna caoda! And, by the way, you wouldn't eat it without at least inviting your friends.
253
It's not the right time to read books.
254
It's a gas chandelier, finely decorated with floral castings on the arms and etched glass shades.
255
You already washed yourself.
256
It's a very nice garden, full of flourishing roses.
257
It's the barn where your father and your uncle assembled their first cars, eight years ago. Now the factory is much bigger and is not located here anymore. Your family still uses the barn as a personal garage.
258
You have a look at your father's clothes, but there's nothing unusual.
259
Lighting gas is happily burning there and a thorium mantle radiates a very pleasing and warm yellow light.
260
Your family loves roses. They're wonderful.
261
It's a collection of copper pans, tinned on the inside, of different sizes.
262
It's a large stove, useful for cooking and heating the place. In your family, you call that a putagé.
263
It's a pretty ordinary sink.
264
You see the garden outside and the back wall of a barn.
265
Democrito acts like he would greatly appreciate it, but first you should find a place to put it.
266
It's your mother's piano. Your uncle too was a very good pianist when he was younger. He still likes to play the piano, sometimes.
267
You play a few notes of J.S. Bach's prelude in C, from the first Well Tempered Clavier book. You always liked this piece, and the much harder 4-part fugue that follows it.
268
These are pilot goggles. And, technically speaking, you're a pilot.
269
Why would you do something so silly?
270
On a bench, there's something written: "RICCOBENE TESTA DI C*** MOSCIO", that translates approximatively as "Riccobene flaccid d***head". On another bench, "RICCOBENE CREPA MALE" that means something like "Riccobene drop dead badly"... I think Riccobene is definitely not beloved by his students.
271
As in every place where you're supposed to use a blackboard as a blackboard, i.e. to write things on it, there's all needed to write, i.e. chalks, and to erase, i.e. the eraser. What were you expecting? An angry professor may throw a chalk to a student and a really angry one may throw the eraser, but those are not the ordinary way those things are supposed to be exploited...
272
The blackboard has been erased, but it has been used for a lecture today. It's full of chalk dust and some chemical formulas can still be recognised.
273
It's the Egyptian Museum, directed by your friend Schiaparelli. You're here to see him as he apparently knows something about the stolen racecar.
274
Usually people buy tickets there.
275
You see a large space surrounded by columns. You see the sky above it and a cloud that glows purple and orange in the sunset light.
276
Those are framed paintings depicting archeological digs and discoveries. They're nice, but people seems overacting, sometimes.
277
Even if you noticed immediately the sphinx, the other statues are impressive nonetheless.
278
Aligned close to the walls, you see several wooden sarcophagi (called nebankhs) from the New Kingdom period, covered by gold leaf and decorated with images from the Book of the Dead and effigies of the god Osiris.
279
It keeps things together.
280
There are many small statues, currently being studied.
281
It's a very nicely decorated staircase, indeed.
282
It's almost night, outside.
283
^MUse 'SHIBBOLETH RAMASSIN' to jump to this point of the adventure.^M
284
^MUse 'SHIBBOLETH BOGIANEN' to jump to this point of the adventure.^M
285
^MUse 'SHIBBOLETH BOJAFAUS' to jump to this point of the adventure.^M
286
You should discover where to go, before rushing to drive your car.
287
It's a messy desk.
288
The door is already open.
289
It's a nice acetylene lamp. Water on a small block of carbide generates acetylene. It's off.
290
It's already open.
291
It's a metallic manhole cover, barely visible under a thick pile of coal.
292
It's a manhole, open.
293
It's a metallic closet, with a robust brass lock.
294
You pour the saline solution in the lock hole. After a while, you hear a small sound and you're able to open it. Inside there's only a lab coat.
295
They contain reagents. Interestingly enough, one is labeled as ferric chloride.
296
It's a metallic closet, open.
297
It's a solution of ferric chloride, it's brown and dense.
298
There's an aperture in the floor.
299
It's a pile of sawdust, separate from everything else to avoid damages if it catches fire.
300
It's a classic laboratory bench that you find in chemistry laboratories. On top of it, you see a Soxhlet extractor on a Bunsen gas burner, off. It's probably used for a demonstration for students.
400
Decorations on the chandelier represent flourishing pomegranates. It's a very nice handmade artwork.
401
These are all the tools needed to maintain a steam car.
402
It's ordinary coal. Your mother threatened to give that to you instead of treats, on the 6th of January, when you were a naughty kid. There's enough for several long car trips.
403
In the mirror you see a young woman, about 5 ft 6 in tall, with brown-red hair, blue eyes and elegantly arched eyebrows, clad in a simple and elegant dress. That's you.
404
There's a mess on the desk. Among other things, there are tiny bottles of morphine and two syringes.
405
The cabinet is where the various keys of the villa are kept.
406
It's not too hot, here.
502
No.
503
The cat softly meows...
504
That will not help you. Try to calm down and we can continue playing together.
505
What cat?
506
The cat follows you.
507
No. It's better to see what is inside.
508
No. I don't want that with me.
509
Try to find what happened. Examine every object around you. Trace a map. Use your brain.
510
You should try to find Schiaparelli, the director of the Egyptian Museum. He's probably in his office.
511
Explore.
512
Listen, I tried to help you as much as I could to get you there. Now, you're on your own!
513
It's too dark here to see things clearly.
514
Doors are locked from outside
515
You close your eyes and you feel flying high over the city. You see clouds of steam. Then you open again your eyes: nothing changed.
516
It's an anchovy. Smelly.
517
It smells fishy.
518
You'll examine yourself much better with a mirror.
519
You knock the door, gently at first, then more loudly. Nobody comes to open it.
520
I dropped it.
521
It's an old door. Probably, those tunnels are much older than the building that hosts the Chemistry Department.
522
It's a simple and robust shovel.
523
I don't have that with me.
524
Use 'bye' if you want to stop playing.
1000
Okay.
1001
Done.
1002
Done.
1003
You're already carrying too much!
1004
It's too big to be handled!
1005
You can't take that!
1006
You can't do that!
1007
You don't have that with you!
1008
You can't go that way!
1009
I beg your pardon?
1010
You can't.
1011
You already have that with you!
1012
What do you want to do? 
1013
It's dark, you can't see anything.
1018
I wear 
1019
You already worn it.

You notice: 
1032
You have with you: 
1033
You don't have anything with you.
