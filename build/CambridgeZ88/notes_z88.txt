                  NOTES FOR THE CAMBRIDGE Z88 VERSION OF

                                Davide Bucci


This version of the game runs on the Cambridge Z88. Three different formats are
provided:

- .epr file images containing applications, to be used with emulators.
- .app and .apX files, as RAM-installable applications.
- .BAS files, to be loaded in the BBC basic.

Use the format that is most convenient for you!

This port has been made possible by Dom and the awesome z88dk compiler. He also
provided the code for the splash screen. Many thanks to Jamie, for the useful 
feedback, the nice drawing of the splash screen and the the title music (S.
Rachmaninov "Ã‰tude-tableau Op. 39 No. 9")
