                  NOTES FOR THE CAMBRIDGE Z88 VERSION OF

                           TWO DAYS TO THE RACE

                                Davide Bucci


This version of the game runs on the Cambridge Z88. Import the .epr game in
an EPROM and use them as applications.

This port has been made possible by Dom and the awesome z88dk compiler.
Many thanks to Jamie, for the useful feedback, too!
